# Quonauts (4.)5 — Proposals

<a name='1'/>

## #1 — Failed

The purpose of this proposal is to allow players to claim offices. It creates a new rule sub-section to describe the circumstances under which a player can assume an office.

Remove from the Officials rules sub-section all clauses following the first clause, retaining all sub-sections.

Within the Officials rules sub-section and before all sub-sections contained within, create a new rule sub-section entitled "Claiming an office".

To the Claiming an office rule subsection, add the following five clauses:

"A player may claim any unclaimed office by announcing that they do so in the <#607965760006127616> channel."

"An official may not under any circumstance assume a second office."

"An official may not under any circumstance resign an office."

"An official may pass their office to another player only if the other player agrees to accept the office."

"A player may seize the office of an inactive official."

## #5 — Passed

Replace the contents of rule 1.4.4 with the following:
```
If a player (hereby "the convicted player") is convicted, then another player may conduct a majority poll (called a "puninitive action poll") to determine whether punitive action should be taken.

Players should vote in favour of this poll if, and only if, they believe the convicted player violated the rules knowingly and with malicious intent.

Any vote in such a poll cast by the convicted player is not counted.

If a punitive action poll passes, then the convicted player gains one strike.
```

A zerbo is either a parasitic species of alien meiofauna, or an unobservable variant of subatomic particle that breaks time symmetry, depending on the viewer.  Exactly n2^x zerbos exist at any given time, where n is the number of zerbos when the number of zerbos was last altered by a player, and x is the number of whole 24 hour periods since that alteration.  If a player owns any zerbos they are immediately removed from existence and n is set to the remaining number of zerbos, and x is set to 0. Upon the passage of this rule, n is set to 1 and x is set to 0.

Add a new rule section after "Polls" titled "Binding agreements", with the following content:

One or more players may at any time create a binding agreement. It must be clear to all players, involved or uninvolved, that such an agreement is being made, and an agreement cannot be made without the support of all involved players  A binding agreement has terms, which can govern any in-game actions (including sending messages) that the involved parties may take. The terms may make use of conditions based on exact times, certain actions, or any other criteria. At no point can the terms of a binding agreement be broken by a member of the agreement, and if such an event occurs, it should be handled like any violation of the rules.

Money is like any other quantity but with the following exceptions:

Add a new rule section after "Actions" titled "Questing" with the following content:

As a game action, a player with a positive health value may start a quest. To begin a quest, they roll a 10-sided die. Name the result of this roll m. Then, roll a 100-sided die, multiply by m and name it r. The quest now begins. m times, the player must fight a monster.

To fight a monster, roll a 12-sided die. Name the result h. Roll a 6-sided die, and subtract the result from h. Then, subtract h from the player's health. Repeat until h or the player's health is 0 or lower, or until the player gives up. If h was reduced to 0 or lower, the player fights another monster until all are defeated. If the player's health was reduced to 0 or lower, the quest ends.

If the player successfully defeats all of the monsters, they immediately gain r money.

## #48 — Failed

Add a new rule section: Companies
>>> Any player can found a company by formal declaration, including a name for the company and optionally a list of owners (must include the founder) and rules how to determine responsibilities amongst multiple owners. Companies count as players for all purposes and have their own value in all quantities unless specified otherwise.

Companies cannot gain or lose points and cannot win the game. Companies can submit proposals but not vote on them.

A company needs to declare how following responsibilities are managed by its owners:
- Representation: the right to perform actions in the name of the company, eg. make proposals
- Administration: the right to modify the declaration of the company, including changing its name, adding new owners and dissolving the company
- Finances: the right to trade with tradable company quantities (such as money)
- Liability: The obligation to share strikes a company gets. Whenever the company gets a strike for whatever reason, at least one owner must also get a strike as result.

The player who founds a company will initially be its owner. If a company has a single owner, that player fully bears all responsibilities. If a company has multiple owners, the declaration MUST define how to determine to what extent each responsibility is applicable to the individual owners. Players can't be given (co-)ownership of a company against their will.
