# Quonauts 5 — Proposals

<a name='1'/>

## #1 — Failed

The purpose of this proposal is to allow players to claim offices. It creates a new rule sub-section to describe the circumstances under which a player can assume an office.

Remove from the Officials rules sub-section all clauses following the first clause, retaining all sub-sections.

Within the Officials rules sub-section and before all sub-sections contained within, create a new rule sub-section entitled "Claiming an office".

To the Claiming an office rule subsection, add the following five clauses:

"A player may claim any unclaimed office by announcing that they do so in the <#607965760006127616> channel."

"An official may not under any circumstance assume a second office."

"An official may not under any circumstance resign an office."

"An official may pass their office to another player only if the other player agrees to accept the office."

"A player may seize the office of an inactive official."

## #5 — Passed

Replace the contents of rule 1.4.4 with the following:
```
If a player (hereby "the convicted player") is convicted, then another player may conduct a majority poll (called a "puninitive action poll") to determine whether punitive action should be taken.

Players should vote in favour of this poll if, and only if, they believe the convicted player violated the rules knowingly and with malicious intent.

Any vote in such a poll cast by the convicted player is not counted.

If a punitive action poll passes, then the convicted player gains one strike.
```

A zerbo is either a parasitic species of alien meiofauna, or an unobservable variant of subatomic particle that breaks time symmetry, depending on the viewer.  Exactly n2^x zerbos exist at any given time, where n is the number of zerbos when the number of zerbos was last altered by a player, and x is the number of whole 24 hour periods since that alteration.  If a player owns any zerbos they are immediately removed from existence and n is set to the remaining number of zerbos, and x is set to 0. Upon the passage of this rule, n is set to 1 and x is set to 0.

Add a new rule section after "Polls" titled "Binding agreements", with the following content:

One or more players may at any time create a binding agreement. It must be clear to all players, involved or uninvolved, that such an agreement is being made, and an agreement cannot be made without the support of all involved players  A binding agreement has terms, which can govern any in-game actions (including sending messages) that the involved parties may take. The terms may make use of conditions based on exact times, certain actions, or any other criteria. At no point can the terms of a binding agreement be broken by a member of the agreement, and if such an event occurs, it should be handled like any violation of the rules.
