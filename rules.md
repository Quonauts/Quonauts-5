## <a name='rule-violations'/> Rule violations

A rule violation is a game action that is not permitted by the rules.

Resolving a rule violation is the process of reversing the immediate effects of that rule violation (not including any indirect effects permitted in reaction to the rule violation) to the extent that it is possible.

### <a name='errors'/> Errors

An error is a rule violation made by a player either mistakenly or through ignorance. If a player causes a rule violation and is able to resolve the error, they may do so.

If a player resolves an error within 24 hours of making that error, and the resolution of the error leaves the game state in such fashion that it is as if the error had never occurred, no punitive action can be taken against the player.

### <a name='judgements'/> Judgements

Judgements are rulings made by an official known as The Arbiter.

If any player ("the accusing player") believes that another player (hereby "the accused player") has violated the rules, then the accusing player may call upon The Arbiter to make a judgement. The accusing player must describe which sections or clauses of the rules were violated and what illegal game action was taken by the accused player. The Arbiter must make a judgement on whether a rule violation took place.

If The Arbiter determines that a rule violation took place, the rule violation must be resolved, if it has not already.

Whenever the Arbiter makes a judgement they may spend an action. If they do, they gain three points.

### <a name='appeals'/> Appeals

If any player believes that a judgement made by The Arbiter is incorrect they may cite the specific judgement in an appeal poll.

Players should vote in favor of this poll if, and only if, they agree that the accused player violated the rules as described.

Any vote in such a poll cast by The Arbiter or the accused player in the cited judgement is not counted.

An appeal poll must be available for voting for at least 24 hours before any action may be taken as a result.

For any given ruling, only one appeal poll may be conducted.

An appeal poll may not be started more than seven days after the cited ruling.

If an appeal poll passes, any effects of the judgement are overturned.

### <a name='punitive-action'/> Punitive action

Punitive action is to be determined by an official knows as The Justice.

If a player is judged to have violated the rules, The Justice must determine what punitive action is taken. The Justice may select any combination of the following:
- A fine of up to ten points
- An award of one strike.
- Stripping the player of any office held.
In addition, a player that has punitive action taken against them may not assume any office for 24 hours after punitive action is taken.

## <a name='timezones'/> Timezones

Unless otherwise specified, all times and dates are specified with respect to UTC.

## <a name='meta-rules'/> Meta rules

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

### <a name='accuracy'/> Accuracy

This document is not guaranteed to always be up-to-date as the game rules are modified, however it is the duty of all players to keep this document accurate as game rules are modified. Where this document disagrees with the game rules, players must follow the game rules as they legally are, rather than their description in this document.

### <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:
1. If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence.
2. If one clause is negative while the other is positive, then the negative clause takes precedence.
3. The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.

### <a name='disallowed-by-default'/> Disallowed by default

Unless explicitly stated in the rules, all game actions are forbidden.
