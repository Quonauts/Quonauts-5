### <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:  1. If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence. 2. If one clause is negative while the other is positive, then the negative clause takes precedence. 3. The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.
