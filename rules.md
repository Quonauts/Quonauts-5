## <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:
1. If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence.
2. If one clause is negative while the other is positive, then the negative clause takes precedence.
3. The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.

## <a name='disallowed-by-default'/> Disallowed by default

Unless explicitly stated in the rules, all game actions are forbidden.

## <a name='rule-violations'/> Rule violations

A rule violation is a game action that is not permitted by the rules.

Resolving a rule violation is the process of reversing the immediate effects of that rule violation (not including any indirect effects permitted in reaction to the rule violation) to the extent that it is possible.

### <a name='errors'/> Errors

An error is a rule violation made by a player either mistakenly or through ignorance. If a player causes a rule violation and is able to resolve the error, they may do so.

If a player resolves an error within 24 hours of making that error, and the resolution of the error leaves the game state in such fashion that it is as if the error had never occurred, no punitive action can be taken against the player.

### <a name='judgements'/> Judgements

Judgements are rulings made by an official known as The Arbiter.

If any player ("the accusing player") believes that another player (hereby "the accused player") has violated the rules, then the accusing player may call upon The Arbiter to make a judgement. The accusing player must describe which sections or clauses of the rules were violated and what illegal game action was taken by the accused player. The Arbiter must make a judgement on whether a rule violation took place.

If The Arbiter determines that a rule violation took place, the rule violation must be resolved, if it has not already.

Whenever the Arbiter makes a judgement they may spend an action. If they do, they gain three points.
