## <a name='meta-rules'/> Meta rules

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

### <a name='rule-violations'/> Rule violations

A rule violation is a game action that is not permitted by the rules.

Resolving a rule violation is the process of reversing the immediate effects of that rule violation (not including any indirect effects permitted in reaction to the rule violation) to the extent that it is possible.

#### <a name='punitive-action'/> Punitive action

Punitive action is to be determined by an official knows as The Justice.

If a player is judged to have violated the rules, The Justice must determine what punitive action is taken. The Justice may select any combination of the following:
- A fine of up to ten points
- An award of one strike.
- Stripping the player of any office held.
In addition, a player that has punitive action taken against them may not assume any office for 24 hours after punitive action is taken.

### <a name='timezones'/> Timezones

Unless otherwise specified, all times and dates are specified with respect to UTC.

### <a name='bots'/> Bots

Certain game functions may be performed automatically by automated "bots;" the behavior of such bots is not governed by the rules, and any function that bots may perform should be feasible, even if inconvenient, to do manually.

### <a name='style-conventions'/> Style conventions

This section and its subsections describe grammatical and stylistic conventions used throughout this ruleset.
Any player may edit the rules to conform to these style conventions. Edits made this way must otherwise be minimal; i.e. they may not change wording or meaning.
